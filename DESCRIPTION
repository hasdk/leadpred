Description: This package provides methods for predicting lead concentrations in cord blood using weekly child dentine lead measurements. The predictions are generated from a trained XGBoost model that takes as input 17-week dentine lead levels data around birth, in addition to (optional) covariates: infant sex, maternal age, exposure to sexond hand smoking, and socio-economic status. The package also provides methods for imputing missing values of dentine lead measures.
